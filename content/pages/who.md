Hello! I'm **Tim Rekelj**, currently in my third year studying **Computer Science at the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science**. I'm passionate about technology's ability to solve complex challenges and improve our lives.

Over the course of my studies, I’ve developed a strong foundation in various programming languages and technologies, including **Python**, **Java**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **C**, **Odin**, **Vue**, **Docker** etc. while also deepening my understanding of computer systems, algorithms, and data structures.

From 2021 to 2023, I worked at [**XLAB**](https://xlab.si/), where I contributed to several web development projects, frequently using **Docker**, **Vagrant**, **Python**, **Angular** and **Ansible**.
In the summer of 2023, I ventured into a startup called [**Prskalnik**](https://prskalnik.si) with two of my friends. We worked with **Vue** and **Supabase**.
While initially focused on web development, my interests gradually shifted towards lower-level programming and high-performance computing.
As a result, I stepped away from **Prskalnik** and got into [**Razorpeak**](https://razorpeak.io), where I now work with high-performance **Java**.

In my spare time, I’m diving into languages like **Rust** and **Odin** to further explore lower-level systems programming.
Over the years, as I’ve worked with and developed a variety of software, I’ve observed a decline in the focus on program quality. As I continue to grow in my career, my core objective is to create software that places the highest importance on both quality and performance.
