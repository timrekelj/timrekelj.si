Hi there! My name is **Tim Rekelj** and I'm a 2nd grade computer science student at **University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science**. I've always been fascinated by the potential of technology to solve complex problems and improve people's lives.

Throughout my studies, I've gained a solid foundation in programming languages and technologies such as *Python*, *Java*, *Javascript/Typescript*, *C*, *Vue*, *Docker*, *Vagrant*, *Ansible*, as well as an understanding of computer systems, algorithms and data structures. But what really drives me is the challenge of using these skills to create innovative solutions to real-world problems.

When I'm not in class, you can often find me participating in hackathons, where I enjoy putting my skills to the test and collaborating with other like-minded individuals. I'm also an active member of FRI student organisation [**FRIKI**](https://www.instagram.com/sofri_friki/), where I love sharing my knowledge and working on projects with my peers.

In my 2.5 years working at [**XLAB**](https://xlab.si/), I helped with building multiple projects. The technologies I used the most are *Docker*, *Vagrant*, *Python* and *Ansible*. I enjoy collaborating with other members of the team to find creative solutions to complex problems, and I'm always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and skills in the field.

Ultimately, my goal is to use my passion for technology to make a positive impact on the world. I believe that technology has the power to make a real difference in people's lives. I'm excited to continue learning and growing in the field of computer science, and I can't wait to see what the future holds!

P.S. I am writing my blog because:
 - I want to upgrade my communication skills and english language
 - the unused domain is driving me crazy
 - I want to document the new stuff I learn
 - why not
